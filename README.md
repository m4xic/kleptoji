> a bot with a very strong wish to steal Discord emojis that they cannot control

A self-made bot that functions as a clone of Remoji (without the requirement to vote for it on some bot leaderboard every 24 hours)

# To use

1. `git clone` the repo, or download the ZIP file above.

2. Create a `.env` file that looks like this, putting your [Discord API token](https://discord.com/developers) after the equals sign.

```bash
KLEPTOJI_KEY=
```

3. ???

4. Profit. Type `steal <emojis>` in a channel where Kleptoji has `Read Messages` permissions, and you're golden ✨

---

**Kleptoji needs the `Manage Emojis` permission in any servers where you want them to work.**

Because, y'know, the whole point is it uploads emojis.
